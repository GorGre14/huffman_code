# Huffman Coding Project

Implementation of Huffman coding for data compression, studying both theoretical and practical aspects of information theory.

## Repository Contents

- `huffman_report.pdf` - Comprehensive 10-page report analyzing Huffman coding for message compression
- `huffman_code.py` - Python implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm
- `latex/` - LaTeX source files for the report
- `report_text.md` - Draft text content for the report

## Key Features

- Single-symbol and pair-based (k=1 and k=2) Huffman coding implementation
- Entropy analysis and comparison of compression efficiency
- Performance evaluation with probability distribution shifts
- Canonical Huffman code implementation for efficient storage

## How to Run

```bash
python huffman_code.py
```

This will generate an example Huffman encoding for a six-letter alphabet with a skewed probability distribution, comparing k=1 and k=2 compression schemes.
